      /* LOOKUP_TABLE is a global object. We are going to use it as
         dictionary to lookup the morse code for each letter and digit.

         The elements of the dictionary are defined inside the curly braces { }

         Each element has a key (before the semi-colon) and a value (after the semi-colon). 

         For example:

         LOOKUP_TABLE["A"] returns ".-"

         We pass the key we want to look for in the square brackets [] (e.g. "A") and JavaScript 
         returns the matching value (e.g. ".-")

         If there is no match JavaScript returns a special value called undefined

         LOOKUP_TABLE is a global variable meaning any JavaScript code on the page can use it.

         The = is called the assignment operator and it stores the dictionary object in the variable called
         LOOKUP_TABLE.
